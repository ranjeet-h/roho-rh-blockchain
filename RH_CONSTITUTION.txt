ROHO (RH) BLOCKCHAIN CONSTITUTION
==================================

Enacted: 2026-01-08
Version: 1.0 (Final, Immutable)

This document defines the immutable rules of the ROHO blockchain.
Once the genesis block is created, these rules cannot be changed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ARTICLE I — MONETARY SUPPLY

Section 1. Total Supply
The total supply of ROHO is exactly 100,000,000 RH.
This limit is absolute and cannot be exceeded under any circumstances.

Section 2. Founder Allocation
The founder receives 10,000,000 RH in the genesis block.
This is the only pre-mine. There are no other allocations.

Section 3. Public Issuance
The remaining 90,000,000 RH is issued through mining.
Issuance follows an asymptotic decay function.
Issuance naturally halts by the year 2200.

Section 4. No Inflation
No new coins can ever be created beyond the total supply.
No burning mechanism affects the total supply cap.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ARTICLE II — CONSENSUS MECHANISM

Section 1. Proof of Work
Consensus is achieved through Proof of Work mining.
There is no Proof of Stake. There is no delegation.

Section 2. Hash Function
The hash function is BLAKE3.
This cannot be changed.

Section 3. Block Time
The target block time is 600 seconds (10 minutes).
Difficulty adjusts every 2016 blocks to maintain this target.

Section 4. Difficulty Adjustment
Adjustment is purely mathematical.
Maximum adjustment per period is 4x in either direction.
There are no emergency rules. There are no overrides.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ARTICLE III — CRYPTOGRAPHY

Section 1. Signatures
Transaction signatures use Schnorr signatures on secp256k1.

Section 2. Addresses
Addresses begin with "RH" followed by Base58Check encoding.

Section 3. Ledger Model
The ledger uses the UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) model.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ARTICLE IV — GOVERNANCE

Section 1. No Governance
There is no on-chain governance.
There is no voting mechanism.
There is no treasury.
There is no foundation with special powers.

Section 2. No Upgrades
The protocol does not upgrade.
There are no hard forks planned.
There are no soft forks planned.

Section 3. No Authority
No individual, group, or entity has authority over the protocol.
The founder has no special privileges after genesis.

Section 4. Social Consensus Only
If the community wishes to change direction, they must fork.
The original chain continues unchanged regardless.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ARTICLE V — IMMUTABILITY

Section 1. Bugs Are History
If a bug is discovered, it is history — not a task.
There is no admin fix.
There is no emergency fork.
There is no coordinated response.

Section 2. No Rollbacks
Transactions are final.
There are no reversals.
There is no "community decision" to undo history.

Section 3. Node Compliance
Any node rejecting these rules is NOT part of the ROHO network.
Compliance is binary. There is no partial participation.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ARTICLE VI — FINALITY

This constitution is final.
It cannot be amended.
It cannot be extended.
It cannot be reinterpreted.

The code is the law.
The math is the authority.
The chain is the history.
